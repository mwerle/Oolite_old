These versions of the Ogg and Vorbis libraries were built from the
libogg-1.1.3 and libvorbis 1.2.0 tarballs, available from
<http://www.xiph.org/>, using the enclosed modified versions of the
XCode projects included in those tarballs.

LibOgg.a contains libogg, built for ppc, ppc64, i386 and x86_64
architectures.
LibVorbisAll.a contains libvorbis, libvorbisfile and libvorbisenc
built for ppc and i386 architectures.

The ogg and vorbis directories contain header files copied from
the tarballs.
