Playing Oolite
==============

What is it?
-----------
Oolite is a space sim game, written for Mac OS X in Objective C using
Cocoa and OpenGL. It has been ported to Linux and GNUstep.

It was written by Giles Williams in response to the withdrawal of 
Elite - The New Kind from the internet. Although inspired by the work of 
Christian Pinder, following David Braben and Ian Bell, the work is an 
independent interpretation and expansion of the original game.

Oolite is designed as a small game that is easy for users to pick up 
and expand upon. Almost every aspect of the game can be modified using 
simple, free graphics packages and text-editors.

The game and source-code are offered for free under a Creative Commons 
License. One of Giles's priorities for development was to separate the game 
engine from the game materials (graphics, models, AI, text-strings etc.).

How to play it
--------------
If you've not heard of Elite (what rock have you been hiding under since
1984?), Oolite works in pretty much the same way. You trade to make money -
in the meantime fighting off pirates who want to steal your cargo.
To increase your profit (and lessen your chances of dying) you may need
to spend that money on ship upgrades, or perhaps a larger ship.
Or...you may decide to become a pirate yourself! Or you may decide to
be a bounty hunter - picking off the pirates to earn the bounty on their
heads. Your combat rating reflects your skill as a combat pilot - it
goes from Harmess through to Elite.

Watch out if you choose the piracy route - if you get caught by the Police
Vipers, they will show no mercy.

If you're good, you may from time to time get a special mission...

To install OXPs, if you installed Oolite system-wide, put them in
/usr/local/AddOns. If you installed into your home directory, put them
in $HOME/AddOns. (Note: in future releases, it will be also possible to
use your home directory in the case of system-wide installs).

There are OXPs for additional missions, new ships and new game elements.
